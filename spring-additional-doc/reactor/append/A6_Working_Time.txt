I want to associate emissions with a timing (Tuple2<Long, T>) measured…​

since subscription: elapsed

since the dawn of time (well, computer time): timestamp

I want my sequence to be interrupted if there is too much delay between emissions: timeout
I want to get ticks from a clock, regular time intervals: Flux#interval
I want to emit a single 0 after an initial delay: static Mono.delay.

I want to introduce a delay:
    between each onNext signal: Mono#delayElement, Flux#delayElements
    before the subscription happens: delaySubscription
