Note: all of these methods except Mono#toFuture will throw an UnsupportedOperatorException if called from within
a Scheduler marked as "non-blocking only" (by default parallel() and single()).

I have a Flux<T> and I want to:
    block until I can get the first element: Flux#blockFirst
    with a timeout: Flux#blockFirst(Duration)

    block until I can get the last element (or null if empty): Flux#blockLast
    with a timeout: Flux#blockLast(Duration)

synchronously switch to an Iterable<T>: Flux#toIterable
synchronously switch to a Java 8 Stream<T>: Flux#toStream

I have a Mono<T> and I want:
    to block until I can get the value: Mono#block
    with a timeout: Mono#block(Duration)
    a CompletableFuture<T>: Mono#toFuture
